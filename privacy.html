						</p>
						<h3>
							11. How we use cookies
						</h3>
						<p>
							A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Once you agree,
							the file is added and the cookie helps analyze web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular
							site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor
							its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your
							preferences. <br>
							We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us to analyze information
							about web page traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to our customer needs. We only use
							this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the information is removed from the system.
							<br>
							Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find
							useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about
							you, other than the information you choose to share with us. <br>
							You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can
							usually modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking
							full advantage of the website.

						<h3>
							12. Links to other websites
						</h3>
						<p>
							Our website may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to

							cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting
							such sites and such sites are not governed by this Privacy Policy. You should exercise caution and look at

						</p>
						<h3>
							13. Controlling your personal information

							You may request details of personal information which we hold about you. A small fee will be payable if
							request will be excessive or manifestly unfounded (for example, where you make repetitive requests to
							supply you with the information). If you would like a copy of the information held on you, please send us
							secure message via our client portal, or if you are no longer a client, please write to email us at
							https://yeezypay.io/contacts. Note that while requesting us to supply you with information we will need to

							You may request us to correct or delete any information which you believe is incorrect or incomplete. In
							such case please send us secure message via our client portal, or if you are no longer a client, please
							write to email us at https://yeezypay.io/contacts. Note that while requesting us to correct or delete any
							information we will need to identify your personality. We will promptly correct any information found to
							be wrong. However, if you will request us to delete the information which we must maintain in order to
							follow our legal obligations such as fraud prevention, anti money laundering or counter terrorism
							financing we will need to decline your request and keep that information for five (5) years after last
							settled transaction or from the end date of our relationship, whichever occurs last. <br>
							At all time during our collaboration you have a right to withdraw your consent and hence not supply us
							with your information, stop using our services and stop our collection from the third parties. In such
							case, we will stop processing of your information when all outstanding orders will be settled. If you wish
							to withdraw your consent you may change it in your settings, send us secure message via our client portal,
							or if you are no longer a client, please write to email us at https://yeezypay.io/contacts. However, if
							you withdraw your consent, we will still retain information, which we must maintain in order to follow our
							legal obligations such as fraud prevention, anti money laundering or counter terrorism financing and we
							will keep that information for five (5) years after last settled transaction or from the end date of our
							relationship, whichever occurs last. <br>
							You can object any of our action or inaction in relation to handling of your personal information email us
							at https://yeezypay.io/contacts.
						</p>
						<h3>

						<p>
							We will store information which you supplied for the whole time of our cooperation with you depending on
							the terms as enshrined in the documents which outline our relationships such as General Terms and
							Conditions and/or any other agreements between you and us. Additionally, we will store your information

							fraud prevention, anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing legislation. During this period,
							we do not process your information, unless we are requested to do so by the competent authorities.
						</p>
						<h3>
							15. Children's personal information

							We do not knowingly request to collect personal information from any person under the age of 18. If a user
							submitting personal information is suspected of being younger than 18 years of age, YeeyzPay will not
							allow the user to apply or use our services. Please notify us if you know of any individuals under the age
